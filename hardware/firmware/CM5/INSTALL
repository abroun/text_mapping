Dependancies
=============

Before you can build this code you will need to install the following packages (package names are for Ubuntu 10.04) so they may be different in different distributions

    binutils-avr
    avr-libc
    gcc-avr
    cmake
    cmake-curses-gui    (recommended but not essential)
    python-serial       (this contains pyserial which is used when flashing the CM-5)

Building
=========

To build this code

    mkdir build
    cd build
    ccmake ../

    Inside ccmake press 'c' to configure the make process (you may have to press it twice) and then 'g' to generate the make files

Then run

    make

After this you should have a firmware image called firmware.hex which you can download to the CM5

Downloading and Running the Firmware
=====================================

The CM-5 contains a boot loader written by Robotis that lets you download firmware to the CM-5 over a serial connection. You can see this for yourself by connecting to the CM-5 using something like cutecom and holding down the '#' key whilst powering the CM-5 off and then on.

We use a python script called flasher.py to take a firmware in the Intel HEX file format and then download it to the CM-5 using the boot loader. To use flasher from the build directory after making firmware.hex run

    ../../../scripts/robotis_flasher/flasher.py firmware.hex

Follow the onscreen instructions and your new firmware should be downloaded and run.

Enjoy! :)
