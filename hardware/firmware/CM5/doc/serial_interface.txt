The firmware provides a simple ascii based serial interface that allows for easy control of the firmware over your favorite terminal program such as cutecom or minicom etc.

This interface can be used programmatically using a serial library such as pyserial

To use the interface, connect to the CM-5 using a terminal program at the correct baud rate (at the time of writing this is 57600 bps.

To use a command, type the command name followed by any arguments and press enter. The available commands are

SetGaitSpeed
=============

Usage
    SetGaitSpeed speed

Starts the robot walking with the given speed. A positive speed walks forward and a negative speed walks backwards. A speed of zero stops the robot.

Example
    SetGaitSpeed 0      # Stops the robot

SetAnimFrame
=============

Usage
    SetAnimFrame frame

Sets the current animation frame to be edited

ClearAnimFrame
===============

Usage
    ClearAnimFrame

Clears all motor commands from the animation frame currently being edited


SetMotor
=========

Usage
    SetMotor motorId position [speed]

Puts a motor command in the current animation frame to move the motor with id 'motorId' to 'position' with a given 'speed'. The range of acceptable values for postion and speed are the same as those given in the AX-12 manual i.e. [0,1023]

Note: This command only affects the current animation frame so unless that frame is part of the animation being played the command will not have an immediate effect on the motor

SetNextAnimFrame
=================

Usage
    SetNextAnimFrame nextFrame

Links the current animation frame to another frame. A frame can be linked to itself to form a very tight loop. If 'nextFrame' is set to -1 then the frame is not linked to another frame and so any animation will stop once it reaches this point

SetAnimWaitTimeMS
==================

Usage
    SetAnimWaitTimeMS waitTimeMS

Sets the time in milliseconds before the firmware will move on to the next frame in animation

StartAnimFromFrame
===================

Usage
    StartAnimFromFrame frame

Starts playing an animation from the given frame. Once the waitTimeMS has passed for a frame the animation will move onto the next frame unless -1 has been given as the index of the next frame

StopAnim
=========

Usage
    StopAnim

Stops an animation if it's playing

LoadAnimTable
==============

Usage
    LoadAnimTable

Attempts to load a saved animation table from the EEPROM of the CM-5. This will happen automatically on firmware startup.

SaveAnimTable
==============

Usage
    SaveAnimTable

Saves the current animation table to the EEPROM of the CM-5. This may take some time.


===============
Usage Examples
===============

Simple Animation
=================

This is the serial version of the animation example in main.cpp

    SetAnimFrame 0
    ClearAnimFrame
    SetMotor 1 0 0
    SetMotor 2 1023 0
    SetNextAnimFrame 1
    SetAnimWaitTimeMS 1000
    
    SetAnimFrame 1
    ClearAnimFrame
    SetMotor 1 1023 0
    SetMotor 2 0 0
    SetNextAnimFrame 0
    SetAnimWaitTimeMS 1000

    StartAnimFromFrame 0

Direct Motor Control
=====================

This slightly obtuse example lets you control the motors directly

    SetAnimFrame 0
    ClearAnimFrame
    SetNextAnimFrame 0
    SetAnimWaitTimeMS 0

    StartAnimFromFrame 0        # Start an animation that just plays frame 0 in a loop

    # From this point on any motor commands you send will be executed immediately
    SetMotor 1 500 0
